# DataStruct

This client side app generates interactive visual representations of data structures using HTML Canvas and React.js. It is currently in progress. So far arrays and balanced binary trees have been implemented. The app may aid visual learners in understanding the run-time and space-time complexity (Big O) of various datastructures. Stacks, queues, linked lists, hash tables, and graphs are to come.
